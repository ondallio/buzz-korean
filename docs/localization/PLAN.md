# Localization scope

Localize fixed app-owned desktop text in startup, connection, onboarding,
navigation, channels, messages, threads, direct messages, search, settings,
notifications, agents, repositories, workflows and accessible administration
and experimental plugins. Include menus, tooltips, loading, errors, empty
states, confirmations, accessibility names and app-owned native copy. Separate
mobile/server localization is outside this change.

Use whole templates and named arguments. Persist the device language preference,
preserve mounted drafts/focus during switching, and format dates/numbers for
the selected language with the user's timezone and clock settings. Preserve
user content, API fields, events, saved values, permissions, authentication,
canonical commands and destructive-action guards. Mixed producer errors need
explicit ownership; English-string matching must not reinterpret arbitrary
user/provider diagnostics.

The maintainer explicitly authorized translation wiring/display-only changes in
FOUNDATION files src/main.tsx, src/app/App.tsx, src/app/RecoveryScreen.tsx,
src/features/communities/service.ts and src/features/relay/session.ts. Other
marked contracts need separate guidance. In particular,
src/features/conversation/contracts.ts is unchanged.

The earlier reviewed shell/message/settings/agent/workflow/repository/staff/
status-focus work is retained. This source adds reviewed agent memory and
community scope, direct-message composition, community administration, mention
errors, GitHub settings and Huddle main/call/discussion/companion display.
Huddle language initialization, focus return and retained error/close behavior
have targeted regressions. These are completed bounded implementation units,
not a declaration that every screen or producer is translated. Agent/provider
setup, remaining producer-owned fallbacks and other bundled surfaces still
need their own audits and acceptance.

Implementation owners work in disjoint files and catalogs. The coordinator owns
common registration/integration. Independent reviewers check actual source,
retained behavior and current evidence. Registered keys, screen audits, mixed
producer errors and native acceptance remain distinct. The catalog inventory
must not be presented as a completion percentage.

The keyless packaging entry point reuses the existing build/helper owners and
records candidate bytes. It does not add signing, release activation or an
installer acceptance claim. The dependency repair for rmcp is included; the
broader SQLite/SDK security issue is still unresolved.

Native IME composition/Enter/Shift+Enter, real native controls, restart
persistence, permissions, signed A-to-B updating and the maintainer's own
acceptance test remain outstanding. Keep PRs draft. Agent checks cannot attest
human testing, merge approval or release approval.
